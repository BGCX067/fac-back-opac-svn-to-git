<h2>ABOUT HELIOS</h2>
<p>
	This catalog is powered by the open-source Helios system.  It is designed to present an intuitive
	and powerful interface to searching your library's collections.
</p>
<p>
	Library software is typically very <strong class="bad">expensive.</strong>  This cheats smaller libraries and poorer communities
	out of the best software.  Helios is <strong>free</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Library software is typically very <strong class="bad">inflexible</strong>.  Because it is expensive, companies must protect
	their competitive advantage and keep the software in a black box, where the library can only 
	get to the data the company decides is important and can only change what the company decides
	can be changed.  Helios is <strong>open</strong> and is built with <strong>free</strong>, 
	components and designed to be <strong>tinker-friendly</strong> and <strong>flexible</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Library software is typically very <strong class="bad">old-fashioned</strong>.  New versions only come out once every several years,
	at the most and are often written using outdated tools, technologies and concepts.  Helios gives users
	the same sort of experience they would get on any other major site on the internet.  While the rest of the 
	library software world is at least 5 years behind the times, Helios is <strong>fresh</strong>.
</p>
<p>
	Library software is typically <strong class="bad">user-unfriendly</strong>.  Libraries have far more data about the materials they own
	than Amazon does about the products they sell or Google
	does about the pages they index.  Yet library catalogs are often much harder to use than other sites on the
	internet.  If you don't know exactly what you're looking for and exactly the right words to describe it,
	usually you're out in the cold.  Some of this is due to history, some of this is due to what librarians expect versus what
	everyone else expects, but mostly this is due to dumb software.  
	Helios unlocks the data your library has about the materials they own and
	allows searchers to evolve and narrow down their search intuitively and creatively.  Helios is <strong>user-friendly</strong>.
