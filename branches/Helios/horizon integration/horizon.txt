# To allow item status indexing to work, you must create a table and alter a trigger in Horizon.
# for legal reasons I cannot include the whole altered trigger. So you'll have to modify the 
# trigger yourself. 
# You do not have to do these steps if you just want to integrate Helios into HIP.
 

# 1. create table
create table helios_index_queue(bib# int)

# 2. alter item_iu_trig to include the following logic.  


 if ( select count(*) from inserted i, deleted d where i.item_status = 'i' or d.item_status = 'i' ) > 0
    insert helios_index_queue(bib#)
    select bib# from inserted
